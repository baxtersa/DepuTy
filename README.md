# DepuTy
Build Instructions:
 
From a command line:
 1. cd into DepuTy/src directory
 2. Execute the command 'make depend'
 3. Execute the command 'make'

You should now have an executable file 'lpi' in the top level directory!
If you don't, maybe you don't have the necessary Ocaml toolchain or something?
